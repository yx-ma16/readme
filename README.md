readme
======
This readme file details how to use the optimise function and also goes through the idea of the code.The instrution goes into three parts, including background information, main funciton instruction and code details. To use the optimise function, you just need to read the first two parts of this file. If you want to change the code to achieve a better optimization or implement other functionality, the last part will be helpful to edit the code.
# Background Information
The background information includes model explanation and model simplification. The part of model explanation introduces the actual neck mechanism, while the part of model simplification abstracts the actual mechanism into a geometric model. This simplification facilitates the  process of optimization.
